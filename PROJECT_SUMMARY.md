3. **AI-led Supplier Risk Prediction** (4.8) - Proactive risk management

### **Quick Win Opportunities (Timeline ‚â§6 months)**
- Inventory Optimization (4.4)
- Demand Forecasting (4.7)
- Supplier Verification (4.1)
- Order Quantity Management (4.1)

### **High-Impact Categories**
- **Risk Management**: Average priority 4.85
- **Cost Optimization**: Average priority 4.6
- **Demand Forecasting**: Average priority 4.45

## üöÄ How to Use This Framework

### **Option 1: Quick Start Dashboard**
```bash
./run_dashboard.sh
```
- Opens interactive dashboard at http://localhost:8501
- Filter and analyze use cases by sector, category, priority
- View implementation roadmap and recommendations
- Download filtered data for further analysis

### **Option 2: Python Analysis**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python supply_chain_analysis.py
```
- Generates comprehensive analysis reports
- Creates visualizations and insights
- Exports data to CSV files

### **Option 3: Database Implementation**
```sql
-- Set up database
psql -d your_database -f database_schema.sql
psql -d your_database -f data_import.sql

-- Query use cases by priority
SELECT use_case_name, priority_score, business_impact, estimated_roi
FROM use_cases 
ORDER BY priority_score DESC;
```
